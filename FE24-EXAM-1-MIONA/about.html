<h2 class="h2" id="history">History</h2>
<p>Serious Eats was founded in 2006 by author and journalist Ed Levine, who envisioned Serious Eats as a haven for enthusiastic and opinionated eaters just like him. Since then, Serious Eats has evolved from its days as a blog covering food trends and the restaurant industry into a full-fledged food resource best known for its recipe and instructional cooking content.</p>


<h2  class="h2" id="about_us">About us</h2>
<p>Serious Eats is an award-winning food and drink website visited by over 7 million hungry readers every month. Our audience comes to us for rigorously tested recipes, science-driven cooking techniques, robust equipment reviews, and stories that offer cultural and historical context to the foods we love to eat.</p>
